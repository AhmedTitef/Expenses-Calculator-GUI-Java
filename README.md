# Expenses-Calcualor-GUI-Java
Create a GUI application with JavaFX that calculates and displays the total travel expenses of a businessperson on a trip. The user must provide the following information:

Number of days on the trip
Transportation Cost (ONE or the other):
Airfare Cost, or...
Miles driven, if a private vehicle was used
Conference registration Cost
Lodging Cost (per night)
Food Cost (total)
The company reimburses travel expenses according to the following policy:

Up to $47 per day for meals total. If the user spends less than $47 per day, they pay $0 for food... HOWEVER the extra money does not get applied to another category).
Lodging charges up to $195.00 per day (same rules as above)
If a private vehicle is used, $0.42 per mile driven.
The entire registration fee.
When the user submits their info, the application should calculate and display the following:

Total expenses incurred by the businessperson.
How much the businessperson owes after all reimbursements (if this number is negative in the event that they owe a small amount or 0 and their gas reimbursement is larger, that is okay!)
